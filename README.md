This is the first iteration of our trial.
This makes use of the qualcomm ai hub models and the app is built from scratch on our own.

There is use of generative AI. As when the model was working slow and was not detecting the pose which was not the part built by us we found it impossible to debug as the model was pre-built and we were just calling it. So we tried asking generative AI what 
the error could be and it made a few optimisation chnages to the code.
